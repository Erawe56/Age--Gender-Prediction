# Age-Gender-Prediction
It is a project that predicts the age and gender of a person with a deep running model. The neural network is trained on a dataset that contains human facial images, which are then used to predict the age and genderProject Overview

Objective: Develop a model that predicts age and gender from facial images.
Dataset: Used a publicly available dataset containing labeled images for training and testing.
Model: Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) due to its effectiveness in image processing tasks.

Key Features :

Data Preprocessing: Included image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.

Model Architecture: Utilized multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling and fully connected layers.

Training: Applied techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for age prediction and accuracy for gender classification. of new images.
